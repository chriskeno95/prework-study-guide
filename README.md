# prework-study-guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
 This guide helped me refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS which i used during my second year of university and introduced me to JavaScript. 
 I built this project so that i could practice the coding that i will be using when the front end web development course starts; it also helped me become more comfortable with Git, which i have never used before, which turned out not to be as daunting as i first thought.
